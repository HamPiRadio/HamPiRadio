### HOLDING PAGE, AWAITING MICHAEL'S FIRST STAB



Hi, Michael.

We need to put a README together for the project. This will give the reader a quick overview of the project (/vision), but I suspect we will break this out into better documentation, in a Wiki, or similar, on GitHub.

Please could you look at the following, and add anything that you want to. I’ll then see what’s missing (maybe nothing), and then you could have the final look through. This isn’t set in stone, so getting it right the first time is not a requirement. The following are just ideas. If you don’t want to add anything to the subtitles/ subsections, that’s fine. If there is anything in the list below that you don’t want in the README, please highlight it. It would be sensible to use words you already have, such as your website.

Thanks,

Chris.
