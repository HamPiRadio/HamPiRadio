### HOLDING PAGE, AWAITING MICHAEL'S FIRST STAB

I am working on this Chris. Please do read over, correct etc. M

Hi, Michael.

We need to put a README together for the project. This will give the reader a quick overview of the project (/vision), but I suspect we will break this out into better documentation, in a Wiki, or similar, on GitHub.

Please could you look at the following, and add anything that you want to. I’ll then see what’s missing (maybe nothing), and then you could have the final look through. This isn’t set in stone, so getting it right the first time is not a requirement. The following are just ideas. If you don’t want to add anything to the subtitles/ subsections, that’s fine. If there is anything in the list below that you don’t want in the README, please highlight it. It would be sensible to use words you already have, such as your website.

Thanks,

Chris.

Second stab:

#### The Ham Pi Radio Project:
HamPiRadio is a 16 band Amateur Radio receiver and transmitter.  A 'Home Build', so the HAM can buy the bits and construst for themselves.
It is designed to receive on LF, HF and VHF bands and transmit on all HF bands with 100W and on 8, 6 and 4Mtr bands on reduces power.
It is essentially an Analog Transcsiver with all the needed controls available (conventional controls - Knobs!) or single press function buttons, for ease and speed of access control.
The Performance is expected to be among the best (Testing shows it is as good or better than an IC-7300). Current test results here: https://hampiradio.com/test-results/

There essentually 4 PCBs to the design and of course they can be used individually for other projects.  The boards are 1. Radio Board, 2. CPU & Keypad board(s), 3. BandPass Filter Board & 4. PA Board.

#### List of features:
For full and ongoing features see the HamPiRadio website:  https://hampiradio.com/features/

#### Contributing:
Contributors / Developers are welcome to this project. We are looking for:
- Compitent RF and Analogue electronic designers to assist with a small number of issues
- Assistance with the mechanical Case design.
- Someone willing to design a 3D plastic Bezel.
- At some point those to do testing further of the RF capability of the transceiver and update the test results (Test euippment will be needed).
- While the software is working really well, there are some 'extra' desirables we have in mind (Such as remote controll over USB, CW paddle (currently 'straight key), a CW decover to text etc).
- 
For Active 'On The Go' issues please join us here:  HamPiRadio Discord https://discord.com/invite/6k9mv8ME

By oprning up this project to others we are looking for 'helpful' and 'active contributions' from others who are keen to get this project flying. We are not so interested in armchair critics or in major re-designing project ideas. The current quest is to polish up this already cool design and get it fully working, reproducable and have others build and use them.
If you are able to report bugs, then please do. Feature requests are encouraged; and any contributions to the documentation/ wiki are welcomed. Why not say ‘Hi!’ in the HamPiRadio Discord https://discord.com/invite/6k9mv8ME 

#### Schematic:
A  schematics will be available on thie repositary. They are in KiCad version 8.0.1 release build

#### Technical Description:
Block diagram? To follow Michael

#### Hardware:
A few sentences about the High Level Design?

#### Operation:
A primary requirement of the project was 'Ease of Use', meaning ease and speed of access to all controls control. No need to wade through menus to find the control you needed in a hurry 2 minutes ago and lost that rare DX!
In any quality receiver it is desirable to vary the gain across the various receiver stages, and have the right filters available at a toush.
The HamPi rotary controls are: AL Gain, IF Gain, AGC Decay, Notch Filter, AF Filter and Noise Blanker (Woodpecker / Static Crash etc).
Keypad buttons cater for full RIT - IRT, ITT and IRTT for split frequency operation. Attenuator and RF Preamp, Mode (CW and SSB), and various others (See features on the website)
Two types of memory...  MW

#### Operating Instructions:


#### Main components:
Maybe a few words or a line about each? Not essential. The Wiki will be the main place for the information.
